I bring a special set of abilities and knowledge to the field of full-stack web development as a motivated and adaptable person. I have a strong foundation in data management and a sharp eye for detail thanks to my experience in finance, accounting and software development. My aptitude for FoxPro for DOS 2.6, Visual Basic 6 and Excel automation utilizing VBA illustrates my capacity to pick up new technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Javascript, Reactjs, Nodejs, Expressjs fast and adapt. As a junior full-stack web developer, I'm eager to use my love of coding to build dynamic, user-friendly websites that improve user experience and promote commercial success.
